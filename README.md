# forrs-frontend
Frontend for Forrs Project - The second yew branch.

## Building and running
You need `cargo-web` installed; then just run `cargo web build` to build the
app and `cargo web start` to run it.

Known issue:  
cargo-web currently has some issues with yew-router, so reloading a page after
navigating won't work.
